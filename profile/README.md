## About CageLab

CageLab is a collaborative project to build a high-throughput and large-scale cognitive training and testing device for many subjects.

## 🚀 What We Do

- **Hardware** - build a low-cost and flexible to adjust cage-attached box, along with reward and input devices.
- **Middleware** - an intermediate tool to distribute neuroscience experiments and collect data from many devices.
- **Software** - PTB-based experimental control, allowing existing experiment code designed for the lab to work in the home environment.
- **Data pipeline** - integrating Alyx to scale data collection to a large number of home environment test devices.
- **Task Design** - Automated cognitive training using a tuned asymmetric staircase.
